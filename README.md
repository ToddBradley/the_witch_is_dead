# The Witch Is Dead


This is a "one page RPG" only it's no longer just one page. The game was created by Grant Howitt and is available here: [https://gshowitt.itch.io/the-witch-is-dead](https://gshowitt.itch.io/the-witch-is-dead).

Later, Sebastian Osborn transcribed it into text as a GitHub Gist, available here: [https://gist.github.com/sebosborn/7c945ed48f93a7b563cec7df32b16bcf](https://gist.github.com/sebosborn/7c945ed48f93a7b563cec7df32b16bcf).

But that version was missing one or two key parts of the original, and I wanted a version that was formatted a bit better, so I edited that text version into the Markdown version you see here. I'm Todd Bradley, and my version is at [https://github.com/ToddBradley/the_witch_is_dead](https://github.com/ToddBradley/the_witch_is_dead).
